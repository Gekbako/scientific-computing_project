### To compile the program:

1. Open the terminal.
2. Navigate to your directory (where all needed files are).
3. Run the following commands to compile each file:

    ```bash
    gfortran -c particle.f90 -o particle.o
    gfortran -c main.f90 -o main.o
    ```

4. Link the object files to create the final executable:
    ```bash
    gfortran particle.o main.o -o simulation
    ```
    
Note: The files main.f90 and particle.f90 are required, with particle.f90 containing the particle module, which is then used in main.f90. This structure is the reason for the final compilation step above.

5. Data generated by the program is saved to various data files and can then be visualized using Python scripts, such as p2_visual.py, etc. For example, in Visual Studio Code, you can compile and view the data output, which will appear in a plot format.

### To run the program after compilation:
1. Execute the compiled program by running:

    ```bash
    ./simulation
    ```
